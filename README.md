# FNSR-Project Description
(Frans Nyberg, Salim Rabat)

The main purpose is to design a very simple yet appealing game. Our idea is to develop a one-player rhythm game. Despite the genre being called rhythm, we realize that music is an optional layer of complexity and it depends how much we manage to get done in time. Our MVP consists of randomly generated inputs, a feedback singal for each correct hit and an ending after either some set amount of time or number of misses, demonstrated by this rather quickly drawn [MVP image](https://github.com/salimrabat/FNSR-Project/wiki/Timing-Game-MVP).

Expanding beyond this MVP, our initial ideas are to have different difficulty levels of choice, possibly more input buttons in case the game becomes too easy, and of course open-source music and graphics.
