# FNSR-Project Description
(Frans Nyberg, Salim Rabat)

Simplicity is a key concern in our project, rather than looking like much to the world.

We intend to develop a Dodger Survival game. Our Minimal Viable Product only includes geometric shapes and their movements, and of course getting hit results in game over. This shy MVP may look like [this](https://github.com/salimrabat/FNSR-Project/wiki/Dodger-Game-Images). Within our MVP is a successive increase in difficulty, such as faster falling objects or more objects. Otherwise it would be an eternal game.

In case there will be time to expand on our game, which I hope there will, current ideas are implementation of background music and colours. These new elements could then further allow for colour-coded blocks such as safe-zones and a rhythmic gameplay, perhaps incorporated with colourfulness. But we intend to be "satisfied" if we only finish our MVP.
