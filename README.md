# FNSR-Project Description
(Frans Nyberg, Salim Rabat)

Simplicity is a key concern in our project, rather than looking like much to the world.

We intend to develop a Dodger Survival game. Our Minimal Viable Product only includes geometric shapes and their movements, and of course gettting hit results in game over. This shy MVP may look like [this](https://github.com/salimrabat/FNSR-Project/wiki/Dodger-Game-Images).

In case there will be time to expand on our game, which I hope there will, current ideas are implementation of background music and colours. These new elements could then further allow for colour-coded blocks such as safe-zones and a rhythmic gameplay, perhaps incorporated with colourfulness. But we intend to be "satisfied" if we only finish our MVP.
