# FNSR-Project Description
(Frans Nyberg, Salim Rabat)

## What we are making

The main purpose is to design a very simple yet somewhat appealing game. Our idea is to develop a one-player rhythm game. Despite the genre being called rhythm, we realize that music is an optional layer of complexity and it depends how much we manage to get done in time. Our MVP consists of randomly generated inputs, a feedback signal for each correct hit and an ending after either some set amount of time or number of misses, demonstrated by this rather quickly drawn [MVP image](https://github.com/salimrabat/FNSR-Project/wiki/Timing-Game-MVP).

Expanding beyond this MVP, our initial ideas are to have different difficulty levels of choice, possibly more input buttons in case the game becomes too easy, and of course open-source music and graphics.

## How to play

The plan is simply to include all relevant files in its own downloadable repository, launch the game from an executable file and play the game in its own window.

Any possible further options are planned to be implemented within the user interface of the game itself and not by just changing files manually. However, as an exception, if the project is expanded to include integration with music of your own choice, it may be possible to add your own music in a folder dedicated to only music.

## Frameworks

We're using the LibGDX game engine, which uses the LWJGL.
